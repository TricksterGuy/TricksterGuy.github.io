So over the past weekend April 13th 2019, I participated as a mentor for Catalyst by the Hack GT team [link](https://catalyst.hack.gt/#important-info).  If you didn't know the event was a "Hackathon" type event for High Schoolers all throughout Georgia, an all day event of STEAM and Computer Science education for free I might add.

There were about 80 mentors and about half were in industry in various companies, some bigger name companies even also sent engineers. I didn't really get the number of students, but I estimate at least 100 (if anyone has a more exact estimate let me know).

The mentees split off into 4 tracks each led by 2 instructors which were college students at Georgia Tech.  The 4 tracks were as follows:

- Software: where students learned to built websites using various web technologies.
- Hardware: where students learned about hardware, circuitry, breadboarding with the Arduino and made some electronic hardware.
- Gaming: where students learned how to create games using Scratch and text based programming in Roblox.
- Design: where students learned how to apply CS concepts to art and made artwork like emojis.

I would have opted to mentor the hardware track, as it sounded interesting and I wanted a reason to finally get out my arduino I purchased a year prior, but the course materials wasn't sent until 3 days before the event, so went with what I knew and went for Gaming.  It would have been nice to learn the material for multiple tracks and then go throughout the rooms when needed.

Anywho, Scratch reminded me of the days of one of the earliest versions of GameMaker (the same engine that brought games like [Undertale](https://undertale.com/) to life) that I experimented with when I was only 12-14, one of the first versions of it was made in Delphi. This was one of my first expereinces in game making.  Even though I didn't really produce anything of value with it and probably cringeworthy stuff if I saw it today. I wasn't at all experienced enough in programming to do any scripting for it, but I was able to figure out the little events system it had, and I made stuff with it. I was happy to give mentees that same experience.

So each track had a similarish setup probably, the track leads would cover a few lessons along with interactive activities where mentees can learn the new technology along with help from mentors, then they would be free to make something for instance the Gaming track had mentees make a small Mario clone in scratch, while the Software section had students come up with an ugly (but creatively ugly) website.

Development with scratch is easy. doesn't require too much effort with the building blocks system, and easily lends itself to having people learn programming via coding. The person who was one of mentees was easily able to add assets to the game, like one of them found the mario music on the internet and added the sound effects to the game and made the game work like a real mario game with the death animation and all, it was all very impressive.

Then lunch, with a panel discussion with engineers afterward.

Then more activity followed for the second part of the gaming track they covered Roblox and how to make games with it, ha again since I didn't have enough time to prepare I couldn't get Roblox installed on my laptop before flying out, and it appeared to be a pretty large installer that wouldn't download on the internet speeds I was getting so couldn't play along with the examples only read, but it was mostly pretty simple code and exercises so I just opted for learning with the mentees as the instructor went along.

Then dinner, and an exploration panel which I didn't know about prior to the event. Many representatives of Collge of Computing clubs were present and a few engineers and was present various things about Computer Science for the mentees to see. Wanting in on the action~ I set up a location and just started showing off my various homebrew games and game making tools as low level applications of computer science. I promise to make a post on these in the future stay tuned! Inspiring people is a passion and couldn't miss out on an opportunity!

Then students got to work on their final projects, something to show off at the end of the day at the expo.  A lot of cool things were made that day, everything from small planes powered by hardware, to little fun games, to cool looking websites, and snazzy looking emojis and other art made with CS.

All in all fun event, I hope it grows further and reaches a lot more people.

And this has made me reminisce about my first encounters with Computer Science, but I'll save that for a future blog post promise!
