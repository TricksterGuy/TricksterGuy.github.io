Well I don't know who will actually read this, but for those interested I guess I'll periodically make one of these types of blog posts. Hence known as **status** post.
I don't know how I will organize this blog in the future or what direction I will go in.  Think of it as an amorphous blob, expanding in all directions ever so slightly with every new post.
Anywho I just felt like writing and I'm sure I'm going to regret this.

## Sooo
Ehh its just a feeling of ennui; however, I do feel that the pandora's box inside my mind opened recently, unleashing a slew of old bad memories replaying on a trigger.
My memory is a double edged sword I can remember people and faces in vivid detail, but toss in an awkward situation or mistake and oh boy is that going to be on autoplay in my mind for the next few days.

I've been off dieting for 13 days now, I resigned myself to take one more week off, before restarting due to poor mood, I can't do this at all if I am not 100% into it. I also hadn't been keeping up quite with my food logging.

            caption="Duplicate sheets galore now, I usually just move the data into another spreadsheet in a very organized manner. Yeah I probably should be using some app..." %}

Prior to this it has been pretty mechanical with tracking anything that I eat or drink and daily weighings the moment after I wake up and do morning routine, adjust food intake weekly based on the data.

Ha but little did I know the one limit was my psyche. Slowly chipping away at it, haha the last time I had enjoyable food was early January, and boy did I regret doing that.
Korean fried chicken! Afterwards I just got extremely tired and slept for 15 hours straight, yeah you gotta cheat slowly and not with one big meal I've learned after experiments while in Atlanta.
But I guess that mistake was a big contributing factor for me not doing anything special. Heck I was in a gym at the start and end of my birthday.

## Perfect Storm?
Anywho not so much a good state I'm in right now, its quite similar to events in 2015. Was near the same weight; however, with a move, loss of daily interactions with people I know, stopped going to meetups,
uninteresting / boring workloads, staying late at work, terrible roommates, less biking into work, stopped inviting people over, just made me slip back into the old habits, in the same amount of time I lost it by the end of 2015 gained it all back.

Yeah the big moral of the story is changing the relationship with food, I'm a big stress/bored eater.  Hitting up the restaurants every weekend or whenever. Especially on nights where I get off work later in the day because I feel like I'm behind on work.
If I don't solve that problem, eventually the big "perfect storm" of events will happen and will take me down when it comes.

Its been pretty on/off since 2015, mostly forming that environment I had early 2015 with some success s/o to those who fit the missing pieces, but yeah if I had to name the period in 2015. It'd be the stagnant era.
I imagine being stuck in a tarpit or quicksand or something and people coming by reaching in and trying to pull me out (ha!). Not really much change from me during that time and only squeaking by with bare minimum.
I should expect more from myself than just randomly answering students' questions and maintaining software.

Anywho ehh hope that wasn't heavy, been cooking up ideas to improve things short term and long term. Whether it mean incorporating a few more cheat days, more gym classes, more meetups,
inviting people over (which only one person came over just when I was moving in), or whatever.

Oh and yeah if not at all obvious, I'm one of those types of people who carry the world on their shoulders. Yeah... You will generally not see me ask for help, only in grave situations.

The other thing is how far I've come along, people reading this from different time periods will have a wildly different description of me. Whether its:

* Grade school Brandon the almost mute guy who only talks to answer questions / human calculator.
* Early College Brandon who still doesn't talk much kicks people ass in Mario Kart and Puyo Puyo.
* Georgia Tech Brandon slave driver / troll teaching assistant who rickrolls everyone.
* Post Georgia Tech Brandon who is a "god" apparently (also light troll).
* Other Brandon who upon getting close with never shuts up once he starts.

Also you can still experience each time period depending on circumstances.

## Gym classes front

I can now increase the amount of gym classes I do a week. Apartment complex provides one for free via Swyft Fitness, but they recently opened a studio nearby (in fact the same time as the Hackathon).
Prices seem decent (IDK) and a good way to meet new people.

| Number of classes  | Total Price | Price Per Class |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 5                  | $120        | $24             |
| 10                 | $220        | $22             |
| 20                 | $360        | $18             |

They also offer a month to month subscription of $120 and a yearly subscription of $1200. Doing 7+ classes with the month subscription is when it starts getting that bang for buck, and yearly you'd have to do 67+ classes.
But if I do time based subscription I know for sure I wouldn't utilize it as much. Just the thought of not getting the full value with the number of classes subscription is enough of a motivator to make me rush in.

I'm just thinking of doing maybe 1 more session a week, but there's a catch, of course I'm inclined to get the best deal, so the $360 for 20 sessions. None of the plans would work too well for that. You see there's a "Valid For" clause.

| Number of classes | Valid For |
|-------------------|-----------|
| 5                 | 31 days   |
| 10                | 50 days   |
| 20                | 75 days   |

And that's how they get ya! Dang it Will! 75 days to come in 20 times along with the one free weekly session the apartment offers for free. Given that I still *feel* the Tuesday session come Thursday/Friday that's probably going to be a tall order for me.

## Solution
Yeah after sleeping on it, this is probably an indicator to make a list of things to do, as long as I am moving forward the feeling should go away. The last such moment this feeling was had the solution is the whole site you are looking at :^)

Forward momentum it is!

The most accurate depiction of all this is the "Enemy Platform" from New Super Mario Bros.  As enemies fall onto the platform the number the platform can take decreases, when it reaches 0 everything stops and you are forced to deal with the enemies before the platform is able to move again.

            caption="Its rainin' goombas in my head!" %}

I figured with the extra cheat days, as long as I don't regain weight and keep it constant this week, I can enjoy the moment. This morning weighed the same as yesterday even though I had more sushi and Asian food. Hitting up Chick-fil-a and I do have gym class this evening. The data here would help clear up some things on cheating.
While I was in Atlanta I didn't do any exercise or ate healthy, while I'm back home though I can prepare more healthy food and go to the gym.

## Gaming
Oh on another note replaying Banjo Kazooie after listening to the OST randomly, man this game is good, but dang if you leave a world without collecting all of the notes, which I did forgetting about that. And most aspects of a world seem to revert when you re-enter.
Ok ok Gruntilda's magic, but still its not hard to have each world have a boolean array (or bitset) sized 100 with each index being whether the note was already collected, and then have each music note tied to an id in the boolean array.
It would be 13 bytes of memory per world, not at all a lot even in 1990s standards. So yeah some things I feel hadn't aged quite well.

Well still better than Donkey Kong 64, collectathon on steriods. With random banana placement and the constant switching of Kongs to even do things.

## Last Word
Yeah I'm probably definitely going to regret posting this. Usually just get troll messages if posted elsewhere I did say you can catch up on everything I do.

I think its time to take up some new hobbies though, I've been doing the same things for the past 6 years. Or at least expand a bit more.

Haha, I remember 9th grade humanities where we was studying the periods of history, and the teacher required us to have a Status book where we record our reactions for a grade.
I remember writing about how I hated the idea and didn't want to share my thoughts. I don't remember what she said, I couldn't bother to look... Haha I know that one teacher probably hated me.

Also the title of this post chosen for all of those people who see me as a god or something. Nope I come with emotional baggage too, I'm just really good at hiding it :^)

One of my core mantras now is "Everyone is fighting their own battle". I wished I could beam that to myself 10 years ago.

### Also

I'm sure some people reading this are going to try and find trigger words or events. Doesn't work that way if you happen to say something in person. The real trick is to put me in a room alone with a loud speaker then say it.
Also probably won't work while in Atlanta / Georgia Tech. I'll just think of that *worse, already resolved* event and negate it.
