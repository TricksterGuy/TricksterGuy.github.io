Short post with just a list of little things to do / direction, I am bound by my word, so anything I write here I must follow.

## Direction?
I'm just considering the angles of where to go with this blog. I'm quite intrigued by this now and a new shiny goal for myself would be to become a better blogger its the *least* I could do, and I'm all for self improvement.

cue [Tressa Colzione](https://octopathtraveler.fandom.com/wiki/Tressa_Colzione) from Octopath Traveler. Without spoiling too much there:

>  Merchant girl doesn't know what she wants out of life until she meets a pirate (who is now a Merchant). After some events and talking, the pirate allows her to take one of the treasures from his ship and out of everything on the ship (plenty of jewels and stuff), she decides to take a notebook of some random adventurer which has no value at all. She reads the notebook and decides to go on an adventure to see the world for herself and to complete the notebook.

So throughout the day I have been taking pictures and saying this may make a good idea for a post, or something. There's many ways I can spin this as well. So short list of ideas and having them here will remind me to make posts on them.

### Playing and reminiscing about older video games

Recently played and 100% Banjo Kazooie, I spend a good deal of time playing retro games. Just like doing opinion pieces on stuff like this, what I liked/disliked

Of course this can be applied to current games.

### Life events

Recently did a trip to the dermotologist (And if he's reading this Hi!) yeah got several shots including one on my face haha so painful!
And about to start the garden again

### Trying out and reviewing products

I do a lot of research online before buying products, I do like good value.
Maybe sometimes a new snack, or drink.

### Weight loss progress

Just got over keto flu today! Yeah down 12 pounds (total) since [The Exorcism](/status/2019/04/30/The-Exorcism.html).
I can also explain my tracking system, and maybe people can suggest better options.

### Recipes

Unfortunately I have not been making anything noteworthy lately [Bare Minimum Chicken](/recipe/2019/04/30/The-Bare-Minimum-Chicken.html) + [Smoothie-39](/recipe/2019/04/30/Smoothie-39.html) fill my meals these days.
I did recently tried the 5 year old parmesan I made which everyone asks me about all the time.
I am also thinking about recipe reviews and my remixes of them.

### The past.

Yeah still owe a post on how I got into programming as promised in [Day At GT Catalyst](/others/2019/04/18/Day-At-GT-Catalyst.html). Pretty different than most people, maybe interesting.

### Programming / Projects

Of course programming is big. I did promise to post up some tutorials on things I'm great at. GBA development, 3DS game development progress.
I've only put up 3 of my projects so far, but I have plenty more!

Another fun fact I did programming/algorithms tutorials as part of my time with the GT Programming Team

### Random life tips

Again I'm the king of discounts, and tips for shopping, though I think most things I know are mainstream, hey maybe I'll learn something myself.

### On self improvement

Yeah another part of this is documenting my many quirks and maybe something will help resolve the negative ones.
But it would be funny for people to randomly come up to me and try to attack with pickles (ugh) or put ice in my drinks (no!)

## Moving forward.

I really want to start over with the code for the blog and make it *truly* something that's mine to where I can say I made this.
Eventually with the defaults I'll want to tinker around with it and then I get annoyed with the template.

So this is now a weekend project to clean things up. I have been making small changes over the past few days, so check everyday you may find something different.
So yeah you may not see new posts for some time, but you may see the layout and things change.

**EDIT 5/8/2019 We now live boys. Bootstrap 4 site. Lost search and related posts functionality which I will readd on a later day.**

[Meta](/meta) documents every single change. I want people to learn from my developments.

### Mentions
Also I should probably start *slowly* mentioning the blog to people who know me, it will be a hard task.
So let's say on average 1 person a day. Plus this gets me talking with people 1:1 again rather than make a post on social media and have a flood of people come in at once.
It also helps with iterating on old posts. I've also been really bad at responding to messages, especially, if you are asking me for something, but hey now I have a counterattack.

If I really get good at this and have content applicable for anyone, it would be good to start mentioning it to random people say lyft/uber drivers when I catch rides. Move up to higher levels and even shared rides.

So far at the time this post was published:

1. Those who asked me for a blog. (~3)
1. Many people who I interact with outside of work (~4)
1. Internet Friends (~12)
1. Random lucky people who I know and trust (~2)

So yeah if you are reading this as of 5/4/2019 you are probably in category 4.

I should really make posts more interactive and get people to comment more, so I at least don't think I'm sending stuff off to the void.
I believe I set things up to where you don't need to sign in with disqus to comment nor comments will be moderated (unless you link something).

**EDIT 5/8/2019 Only shown this to one more person, maybe my manager today as well. So much for goals...**
