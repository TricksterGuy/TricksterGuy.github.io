This post is intended as an day 1 application to [The diet begins](https://tricksterguy.github.io/diet/2019/04/28/The-diet-begins-Week-1.html). Just a day in the life of...

## This is me. Marx

Simply replace cocaine with carbs and high carb foods and there you have it!

It's a slippery slope, day 1 I just eat one meal at a restaurant and a cliff bar to knock myself out of ketosis slowly.

Day 21ish or whatever and I'm running around the farmer's market, downing a whole box of lemonheads (best candy btw!), and then finding yourself at a Red Lobster scarfing down a whole basket of them cheddar bay biscuits :^)

Much like Marx's Black Hole attack, a void that can't be filled...

Haha nah, I just wanted to go out with a bang.

That *had* to have been 5000+ calories easy. Each biscuit is like 160 calories. How many do they put out? Also I go to Red Lobster only for them biscuits, the food was just ok... I don't carry flour in my apartment nor do I feel like looking up a copycat recipe.

###### Brandon rates restaurant food based on if he can do better, in 2/3 shrimp dishes I could do better, not saying it was terrible. Something about Walt's shrimp I don't like. I pull off the breading on that and eat. Shrimp scampi is the best.

It was at that point I started to hate food again. I couldn't finish it all sadly, and good thing because last time I did this (exactly the day before the first day starting this diet) the waitress put a ton of them biscuits in the togo box in which was awkward...
"Uhh thanks, but I can't eat all of these". I do hate wasting food and it was very late and similar situation.


## The spectrum

So yeah its all on the spectrum. To the left you got the more outgoing (or at least attempt to) side, the form that may hang out with people or just message folks, but eats freely. And to the right you have the introverted mechanical side closed off to the world, the side where the weight loss occurs.

Then you have the `bad state`, if I ever get depressed you get the *worst* of both forms, closed off to the world and eating. Eventually I'm Marx black holing food. It's a bad habit...

In the center of all of this you have the Zen state, the happy median point where I'm not too focused on dieting and *correctly* take breaks from it, via 1 small cheat meal, or proper planning.

Have to say these past 8 months have leaned more on the mechanical side of things, setting unrealistic goals (wanted to have lost 100 lbs by February the 6 month point, got there around the end of March).
Yeah weight loss is not linear... I should be accepting and adjust as necessary, and shouldn't demonize a day a month off as long as its not too crazy.

Ha back in January took a cheat day and ate a small boneless wings (10) from [Bonchon](https://bonchon.com/). Was quite careful before hand to avoid the rush of carbs into the system, but wasn't enough.
I should have had a smaller carb meal beforehand, but the effect was right afterward felt **extremely** tired, and slept for 15 hours. Pushing me more towards the mechanical side...

Yeah I guess this is a good 'nuff summary. Can't stay in that mechanical state permanently because it eventually that shield will run out Smash Bros style, leaving me susceptible to `bad state`.


## So now enter today... The exorcism.

With that last meal out of the way and me hating food now, its the perfect time to close the pandora's box, and seal off the demon.

**Can I get an amen in here?**

And so with that I took note that the last thing that entered my mouth was at 11:00 PM, so that means I can't eat until 3 PM.

Easier said than done.

Getting on the scale this morning, I couldn't look. Not only I went past the small threshold I set for myself (+15 lbs) I crossed it by an additional 2 pounds. Great!
Ehh probably additional water weight from eating 5000 calories. No problem.

So working from home, since I had booked an additional fitness class to help prepare for the exorcism, to speed things up.

After agonizing for a few hours it was finally 2:40 PM. I started work on [The Bare Minimum Chicken](/recipe/2019/04/30/The-Bare-Minimum-Chicken.html) like usual.
Grabbed like 255 g of greens (probably like 9 cups? way too much probably), along with Olive Oil via [The Olive Crush](https://www.theolivecrush.com/) s/o to Mike the owner I'll have to do a blog post once I master image galleries... :^)

So I made my one meal for the day.

Of course I log all of my calories and macros

I left the ability to see all of these spreadsheets and numbers to someone I *really* trust. I figure if I posted it on social media someone gonna take a swing at me. Meh.. someone is going to take a swing at me regardless probably. :^)

But the possibility of someone looking at that data will force me to update it and make it nice. Maybe someday I'll post all the data.  Maybe...

To seal the deal on hunger [Smoothie 39](/recipe/2019/04/30/Smoothie-39.html) was formulated. Pretty much using every ingredient I normally use in smoothies. Wasn't bad, wasn't great, pretty creamy due to the mix of nuts and seeds.


## Stage Boss

If my life was an RPG every day features a level boss!

5:45 PM, better start making my way to downtown Sunnyvale, HIIT class. I arrive early, scared I was going to miss it, then again I thought I was going to be the only person this class again. Its like having a personal trainer at that point :^)

Ehh this time the class was focused on lower body, ugh exercises I can't do well just yet oof. Still I do them the best way I can hopefully I can do the full exercises at some point in the future.

So sure after class people are talking, but too bad performing the exorcism makes me pretty spacey, given that I just had a 30 minute bike ride then 30 minutes of HIIT. Was at least able to introduce myself!

But yeah unannounced social situations I tend not to do too well in, there's some prep involved, like a mage preparing spells for the day. Like if I meet someone new and see them in an unexpected area, I will be caught off guard.

I don't even remember the bike ride back, but the cooler temperature plus the breeziness of biking cooled me off.

## Oof

Finishing off the smoothie, along with beef jerky, all of my numbers have been met. No more protein or carbs!

Then a familiar feeling struck, oof mild chest pain. Being a `hypochrondriac` immediately assumed the worst oh no heart attack! Its pretty mild quirk yeah at the most I just look at webmd articles... yeah my arm feels a little numb ugh.

Yeah yeah, after a moment of rationalizing I figured its just heart burn and proceed to take 2 tums tablets and lie down. At some point there was a little jolt. All in my mind...

The heartburn usually is the first thing that happens.

Checked blood ketone levels, Low. Not in ketosis yet, but the first step has started, the sensation that my body is on fire along with deep breathing, as my body begins burning through glycogen stores.

Then just decided to write the night away...

## Uhh well. (After sleeping on this post...)

Sweat buckets overnight, and after many trips to the restroom over the course of the day yesterday, lost 4.6 lbs compared with yesterday. All water pretty much, back under the threshold any progress is good.

Yeah I tend to embellish a little, gotta make things more interesting.  The whole exorcism metaphor, so well hope it was a nice read :^)

Also I guess I go to Red Lobster to just hate food again, OMG please don't judge me. I'm sure everyone has their "basic" chain restaurant they go to.

And yeah I'm aware that the cheddar biscuit mix is a thing, meh, I'd buy it and then never bother to make it.

And.. this whole diet plays out with this playing in the background

At around 1:30 the music gets very feel-sy given a super secret final boss. Kirby games always has the best lore! Yeah need to do the Kirby DLC stuff.

But yeah been closed off to the world lately, don't have to do it alone.
