The week in easy mode continues! I already feel like I need another vacation...

Yup easy mode where, I loosen the restrictions on diet, yet still incorporating healthy food and exercise of course. The goal is to maintain the current weight.
Unfortunately can't do easy mode for other stuff in life... can only meet up with people and work just keeps coming in.

## Yeah work...
Yeah should probably talk about that. Unfortunately this week is my oncall rotation, which is pretty ...fun.  Yeah, each time I do it I chip away at the big block of knowledge about the testbed.
Eventually I'll be able to make big changes for the better there. I always get these at the worst possible moment though. The weeks of: Thanksgiving, Martin Luther King holiday, birthday, and now this week after I come back from vacation and need to play catch up with the main work I do.
And IDK I also get bothered during these because when I open my laptop in the morning to see 3 or so different people pinging me for stuff, so this time being proactive and pre-emptively replying to bugs before they even ask.

That and the ever encroaching demo for code that I have not finish writing yet and being oncall is in the way of making the forward progress there and I should of had this done by the end of march and I didn't know that I was to be oncall after the vacation I just took.
No easy mode for this, but shouldn't be too bad, just have a few more classes to write and then I'll have the basic functionality. Then I'll just need a web front end for the service, ugh.

Other than that poster session went well, kinda wished I cut back on the amount of text I used, really having just the graphics I had made would have made a pretty poster. `TA Mode` Brandon kicked in and `social-anxiety` disappears to an extent.
Definitely periods where there weren't many people, and just fiddled with the phone :^) Standing for 3-4 hours straight and talking to folks really tires me out.
Man I used to attend every single lab for the class I TA'd back in the day 2-4 labs some of them happening concurrently for a total of at least 3 to 5 hours. Now I can't even do this for 3 hours now... the *rust* is real.

## Doubling Down
So as a followup to the last post booked a session with [Swyft Fitness](https://swyftfitness.joinvint.com/activities) which I probably should linked earlier, yeah they do fitness classes for my current apartment every Tuesday.
If you ever want to see *how bad I am at this* just book a session. Anyway I'm known for doubling/tripling down on efforts related to hobbies and stuff like this *Hey Brandon! How's that cheese press going?*
(Really need to start churning out more cheese... Maybe in the future). So yeah I'll just do the 20 sessions and see how it works out. There was definitely a benefit to doing the classes, I saw much more weight loss doing them than not.

Worked from home today so I wouldn't have to deal with biking over two hills to get there in downtown Sunnyvale of just one hill, 3 mile bike ride probably 20 minutes of biking.
Past by old apartment complex (I don't miss you at all), really interesting to see how places change over time, I have extremely sharp `photographic memory` and could recall the names of all students in the course I TA'd (around 200) by the end of the semester.
No way that scales up to todays enrollment (about 2x the number of students). A weird quirk about this is it works based of your hair. Shave or get a haircut and you'd be an entirely new person to me. Weird huh?

Enter Brandon right at 6:30, Will the founder of Swyft Fitness was the instructor and seemed surprised to see me, and the fact that I biked over in addition to that. New studio is really snazzy, located at the center of downtown Sunnyvale, gym has a real luxury feel to it, a bit nicer looking than my current place for sure.

            caption="The studio right in Downtown Sunnyvale" %}

Got some nice schwag for making my way out there, nice needed a new container, as all of the ones I have are too big! 64 oz and 2 1 gallon jugs. Nothing really portable here.
Yeah was the only person for that session, but they just opened I can see more sessions and instructors later.

So yeah blahblahblah workout. Couldn't lift my arms afterward! And hips were already recovering from Tuesday. Dang it Will! Got me again!

After the workout was complete, got a pic.

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-4-25-Eeeh-Easy-Mode/will.jpg"
            title="Will"
            caption="Yup, there's me, I hate taking pics of myself, but well." %}

Then told him about the blog cue `social-anxiety` "Oh and Hahaha I may have mentioned you in a previous post saying Dangit Will",
because I'm just now realizing that these classes are 30 minutes each rather than an hour long, so after a re-evaluation it shouldn't be too bad! Just do the normal Tuesday 1 hr session,
Then maybe Thursday and (Monday/Wednesday/Friday), Saturday classes too early for me. When exactly? I'll probably roll a dice morning of. It was an effective strategy 2015, where I had two paths to work a longer way biking up a hill or a more flat path.
"Alright if I roll 2 or less long path." "2?" "Shit." *Why not just do the harder path everyday?* Yeah, yeah I should have always done the harder path, but man that's a **really** steep hill, and my bicycle didn't do hills well at the time!

So yeah 2 maybe 3 times a week. I don't remember the exact wording here, but Will was like "Yeah I'm here six days a week, so you can come here everyday" Oh god no! Well it wouldn't be TOO BAD if its just 30 minutes, the only thing is just getting down there everyday.
Maybe when I hit that eventual plateau or want to work on actually building muscle or something.

And then because the theme of this week is easy mode, I went right across the street to a restaurant right after. [Nom Burger](https://nom-burger.com/) is great!
I probably ate the same amount the calories I just burned.

            title="Welp"
            caption="Really hope he didn't see me because it was really just down the street. :^)" %}

Also Will if you are reading this, after this point if you see me do this, you got my permission to sprint over and tackle me or something! Just writing this will prevent me from doing so.

## Picky-picky
Also a side note. I am an `extremely picky` eater, very hard to cook for. I only like certain types of foods. So when I order a burger, I just order it plain just add cheese and bacon to it. So the prior day I was with a friend over at Downtown Sunnyvale,
I see the menu and wasn't feeling a pizza, so I went with a burger. My phrasing when I ordered it was "I'll take a burger add cheese and bacon **only**", So I was surprised to see when the burger came with literally everything. So had them fix it and the
waitress comes out all upset and starts arguing saying I didn't say no "lettuce tomato whatever". -Sigh- after 4 hours of talking to people all day I get this.  So yeah cooks have it fixed and send it back out. I hope no food was gone to waste...
Anyway fast forward to the check and I did give her a tip bare minimum amount I give. So me and my friend are talking, catching up after the check, she gives us back our cards.  About 5-10 minutes later she just casually strolls by and asked if the amount was due to that order mistake.
So yeah quickly said no, because I wouldn't have mind a little but it was because she got upset. Seriously though who the heck does this? At that moment I said yeah time to go. Welp I can't eat here again... I'd probably get her waiting my table again and she gonna spit in my food.
Their burgers were alright, bacon was too salty like that waitress.

Yeah definitely call me out if I was wrong in anyway there? It was just that argument that left a sour taste in my mouth. Looking at this restaurant's Yelp reviews, it seems that specific waitress has generated a lot of negative reviews for the restaurant.
And yeah ordering food like that is tough with all of these modifiers and addition, which is why I don't do sandwiches often. [Clarke's Charcoal Broilers](https://clarkes.com/) does it right. You order a burger it comes plain or with cheese and/or bacon.
They have a toppings bar where you can top your burger anyway you like. Like extra onions, go right ahead?! Pickles sure! Want tomatoes be my guest!

And people will probably tell me just take the stuff off.  If it's like a sauce or condiment no. Also I hate when Chick-Fil-a gives me a sandwich with pickles. If there is one thing I hate the most. Its pickles.
People shove those things in foods where they clearly don't belong. Everytime that commercial for Sonic comes on with the guy drinking a pickle slushie I gag a little. Seeing videos on youtube about pickle cocktails and ice cream, Ewww.
Yeah my mom recently told me that Chick-fil-a brines chicken in pickle juice before frying. OK! That's the only time where the use of pickles is ok in my book!
And yeah one could make an argument about all of the fermenting stuff I am doing, yeah yeah I'm aware its the same thing, I'm weird about food ok. No pickles!

Anywho yeah made it extremely clear to waitress over at Nom Burger exactly what I wanted to happen. Really wished I didn't goto so much detail there and come off as annoyed... but just to make sure people understand what the words *only* meant.

            caption="The good stuff! The best crispy fries, I believe they add some flour or starch or something, it really crisps up the fries." %}

Then I got passion fruit juice over at [Bambu](https://www.drinkbambu.com/), another great establishment, glad I beat the rush because 10 or so people just rushed in. I like that you can order a drink with no ice for $1 extra.
Ice really does suck! I recall in Europe ice is pretty rare at least from my trip to Poland back in 2012. But yeah ice in drinks is how they get ya! Good way to pad out the drink and save money.
You give it 10 minutes and now your drink is flat and total loss of flavor, but hey its still cold! Right? Right? Flavored ice cubes guys! C'mon!

## The Escape
So at that point it was 8:30 getting dark and cold cue Wario Land 4 Hurry Up!!! If you played the game the sequence was exactly that.

In Wario Land 4 you play through a level, you are trying to collect Jewel Pieces and Key to unlock the next area and boss, Each level is within a painting with a special warp zone. So you collect the 4 Jewel Pieces and the Key (which is a bird).
To finish the level you need to open the warp zone that brought you there by pressing the switch within the level, but beware there's a time limit to escape the level getting back to the initial warp zone.
These periods can be pretty stressful, and adding onto that the game generally leads you in an alternate path back to the starting are or the mechanics of the level can change completely (imagine a fire level turning into ice once the switch is pressed).

Anywho the music fits the situation perfectly.

Did I mention it was cold, I should of had the foresight to pack my only good pair of sweatpants and just switched into them.

## Last Words
Remember the goal of this week is to just maintain my current weight. If I can do this eating normal everyday food, then this could be a sustainable long term solution to my food problems.
As long as I don't go for Bags and Bags of Doritos, Slurpees, Cake, Ice Cream, and all of those things I should be fine. And well so far I've not gained a pound since Saturday after I came back from vacation so success!

...And so more people are getting roped into this blog. Maybe its a good thing because in person I usually only respond to things like "Yeah" or "K" `man of few words` unless you start talking about something of interest.
IDK I usually find the perfect things to say after the fact long after the conversation is over.

            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jrxl3Op4rsI" %}

Maybe one day I'll just link to it on social media, or maybe for fun I'll wait and see how long it takes for people to discover it, but then again I don't believe I'm ready for a world where people know the `trigger word` system exists.

And I should probably stop eating burgers, I promise after a visit to Shake Shack, ehh I'll probably skip Five Guys even though they are also a favorite, their fries are good too. Ugh so little time left.

And whoops yeah forgot to eat something healthy today since I worked from home, just dumped this whole container of greens into my pan and sauteing it with garlic and olive oil.

And yeah about olive oil, stay tuned next post...
