Hi, you have stumbled upon my blog. Here I will keep everyone up to date with the random stuff I do.  Everything from weekend projects, the random food experiements I do, and code.

So uhh... welcome.

*This blog is intended as a surprise present for a good friend (I do hate this web development stuff), and you all are just caught in the blast radius of said present*! :^)

**Update** 4/22/2019

Surprised friend! Hahaha he did not see that coming at all! I had a poker face the entire night while catching up, and after multiple references to starting this blog! Didn't think I could pull it off.
The best presents are the ones where the person worked hard on it. I could have just gotten some college students to do it for me, but that would lessen the value.

Also snuck in a last modified feature.  Anyway be sure to check back frequently I'm currently going to do some runs to see how comfortable I would be writing posts.  Most of the work lately has been fixing little annoyances.
