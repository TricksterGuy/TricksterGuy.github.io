Every once in awhile I score a hit. This is one of those times. A keto friendly chicken parmesan meatball recipe I came up with.

Unfortunately I have to make some changes to my normal recipe, removing the breadcrumbs which was a big source of carbs.
Usually I form a panade with breadcrumbs and buttermilk and an egg to bind everything together. This results in a more tender, moist meatball.

However just 1/4 of a cup of them is nearly 20 grams of carbohydrates way over my limit.

So the goal of this blog post is to experiment with some replacements. I've tried many different flours as a replacements, and have iterated on two versions
as I make this dish more and more changing the core binding agent I will update the post with the best one I made.


## Recipe

### Basic Formulation

| Ingredient               | Amount          |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Ground Chicken           | 10 oz           |
| Parmesan Cheese (Grated) | 1 oz (28 g)     |
| Garlic Powder            | 1/2 tsp         |
| Onion Powder             | 1/2 tsp         |
| Italian Herbs            | 2 tsp           |
| Crushed Red Pepper       | 1 tsp           |
| Salt                     | 3/4 tsp         |
| Binding Mixture          | 1               |
| Olive Oil                | 2 tbsp (30 mL)  |
| Tomato Sauce             | 1/2 cup (120 g) |
| Cream Cheese             | 1 tbsp (28 g)   |
{: .table .table-responsive-lg}

Of course if you aren't a fan of spiciness the red pepper can be omitted.

**Binding Mixture V2**

| Ingredient               | Amount         |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Egg Yolk                 | 1              |
| Flaxseed Meal            | 1 tbsp (6.5 g) |
| Coconut Flour            | 1 tbsp (7 g)   |
{: .table .table-responsive-lg}

### Directions

* Prepare the binding mixture by mixing the ingredients in the bowl.
* Combine the binding mixture with the spices, salt, and parmesan cheese.
* In a large bowl mix the Ground chicken and the binding mixture. It might be a little sticky depending on your ground chicken.
* Form meatballs from the Ground chicken, I usually go for around 3/4" to 1" in diameter.
* In a skillet heat the olive oil on medium heat.
* Add the meatballs and cook on one side until the meatballs have browned a bit on the bottom and move them so that another side is exposed to the skillet.
* Continue cooking until the other side is also browned and the internal temperature measures 165F.
* Add the tomato sauce and cream cheese to the skillet and turn the heat to low.
* Mix the sauce until the cream cheese is incorporated and combines nicely with the remaining olive oil.
* Once the cheese is fully incorporated the dish is complete.

### On Binding Mixtures
V1 Binding Mixture was just purely the coconut flour and the egg yolk. The reasoning for the Egg Yolk is the Ground Chicken I work with is already quite sticky, another option is to just omit the egg and see what happens.
But it was really workable with the flaxseed meal and coconut flour.

## The Making of

I see cooking similar to coding. The recipe above is only an interface, here's the implementation with the specific brands of everything I use.

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-19-Chicken-Parmigiana-Meatballs/spices.jpg"
            alt="spices"
            caption="Spices" %}

I don't buy Italian Spices directly, I usually just mix 1/2 tsp of Sage, Rosemary, Basil, Marjoram, Fennel, and Oregano.

I source spices in bulk from [Mountain Rose Herbs](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/herbs-spices/bulk).
However for Oregano specifically I opt for imported [Greek Wild Oregano](https://smile.amazon.com/Greek-Wild-Oregano-Fantis-Bunch/dp/B00IPMXV1A/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=wild+greek+oregano&qid=1558340889&s=gateway&sr=8-3), harvested from the mountains of Greece. If you hadn't tried it, it is a very strong, spicy oregano. Very fragrant.
Makes a TON of difference if you sprinkle it on a pizza. A magical secret ingredient.

            alt="binding mixture"
            caption="The Binding Mixture + Parmesan" %}

Any REAL parmesan cheese (not Kraft please!) will do for me. I usually buy one that's aged at least 24 months. While I do have a 5 year old homemade parmesan, I save it for special occasions!

            alt="mixing"
            caption="Chicken with the binding mixture" %}

I source meat from [Greensbury](https://www.greensbury.com/). Everything is grass/vegetarian-fed, antibiotic free and humanely raised, if I am going to be massively restricting the things I can eat better get everything in the best quality.
Plus I have a lifetime discount with them. Here's my

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-19-Chicken-Parmigiana-Meatballs/olive_oil.jpg"
            alt="Olive oil"
            caption="Olive Oil (Tuscan Herb)" %}

Olive oil is source from a specialty store in the SF Bay Peninsula area. In San Carlos there is an Olive oil store named [The Olive Crush](https://www.theolivecrush.com/). I am friends with the owner, Mike, and the products sold in the store are of amazing quality.
I've been a shopper for about 6 years now, discovering his store when I was searching for [Papardelles pasta](https://pappardellespasta.com/), the best most flavorful pasta ever. He mainly sales the pasta, olive oils of
various flavors and regions, and balsamic vinegars of many flavor infusions (I enjoy the Red Apple, Black Cherry, and D'anjou Pear the most). He also sales really amazing bread, Biscotti, spices, beef jerky, corn nuts, and other exciting food.

Also I still owe Mike a blog post on his store :D, but you can order online or if you are in the SF Bay Area visit his stores in Half Moon Bay or San Carlos. It is a wonderful experience and you can try the Olive Oil/Balsamic Vinegar in the store.

But I digress the Tuscan Herb olive oil is the best. Especially for Italian dishes like this one.

About tomato sauce. I usually use [Rao's Pizza](https://www.raos.com/product/pizza-sauce/) sauce for this as it is the only Tomato Sauce I could find with the fewest carbs per serving.

And here's the finished dish.

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-19-Chicken-Parmigiana-Meatballs/finished_dish.jpg"
            alt="finished!"
            caption="Meatballs in sauce!" %}

Unfortunately making food look nice isn't my strong suit. I just make the best tasting dish.  It would look a lot better if there was pasta underneath, but again pasta is a dangerous thing for me.
I will overeat! There are of course low carb pasta replacements mentioned in a previous blog post, but I can enjoy the dish without a pasta.

The taste is very flavorful. The Tuscan herb infused olive oil really shines through in the final dish. Some of the spiciness from the meatballs does also infuse with the tomato sauce, surprisingly.
Well since capsaicin (the main component in spicy foods that gives it its effects) dissolves in oil it comes as no surprise!
