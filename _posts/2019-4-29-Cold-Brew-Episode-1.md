Food post! Welcome to the 10% of my time actually spent experimenting with food rather than trying to find something to feel sorry for :^).  Anywho the process of cold brewing and my equipment are explained here along with the current brew.
Beware, when I get a new **it** thing its all I talk about and I research *deeply* into the topic. This is one such occurrence.

## Before I begin...

One of the things I really **grinds** my gears about recipes on the internet is that the author always start off with their life story talking about some stuff unrelated to the recipe.
If you want to skip my rambling and go straight to the recipe click this **[link](#recipes)**.

In all recipe posts a link will be given in the above header with a link to skip all of the random rambling I do <i class="fas fa-smile"></i>

Mary I don't care about how you spent the summer picking blueberries for your super summer blueberry lemonade.
Susan I don't care how precious your whatever is just give me the recipe!

###### *(Note: I don't know of any posts I read from a Mary or Susan, they are just random names, please no angry comments)*

**If you came here via a google search result welcome I must be doing something right! [Here's](#recipes) what you want.**

## What is Cold Brewing?
Cold brewing is the process of steeping ingredients in water at lower temperatures. You do this for a longer period of time as compared with hot brewing.
Where in hot brew takes in the order of minutes, cold brew would take a few hours or a day or so depending on how strong you want it.

Cold brewing has many benefits, in the case of green tea the end product is less bitter as heat brings out the tannins in the tea. If you've ever steeped green tea for slightly too long or too hot a temperature that's why the taste was poor. The tannins.
And of course heat may destroy enzymes and a loss of nutrients which doesn't happen in cold brewing.

## Inspiration

I got into this after learning about the benefits of green tea during fasting. But taking green tea on an empty stomach is very very bad, again due to the tannins the level of acid in your stomach rises and can cause indigestion and discomfort.
In my case nausea, getting up from my desk at work and lying down on a couch. Not a good feeling at all...

So with cold brewing green tea you get the benefits of green tea, a better tasting result, with none of the nausea on empty stomach.

Though these days I've moved onto matcha, 10 cups worth of green tea with one drink!

Anywho the benefits of green tea + fasting thing was found via this [medium](https://medium.com/@drjasonfung/green-tea-helps-fasting-1f9aded8fa35) article.

## Equipment.

All you need is just a jar, and something to hold your tea in. You are fine doing this with just tea bags in a mason jar. But if you are using loose leaf tea then you will need something to hold it in, or a strainer to remove the leaves afterward.

As far as I go, I use loose lea tea, I have a cabinet full of various leaves and blends. Some from [Mountain Rose Herbs](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/), [Spices and Tease](https://www.spicesandtease.com/), and [Wild Foods](https://www.wildfoods.co/).

As for the equipment to actually perform the cold brew, I'm fancy and have these [ovalware](https://www.ovalware.com/) cold brew maker. It consists of a glass pitcher, with an insert to put in the stuff you want to steep, along with a cap.
I really dig it. When you put the cap on it forms an airtight seal.  And yeah you know stainless steel, BPA free, dishwasher safe. I've really enjoyed them I have 2.

## Recipe

Hey welcome if you came from a google search and clicked the link, none of the above stuff was actually important!

### Basic Recipe for Cold Brew Tea

<!--  include recipe.html recipe=site.data.recipes.cold_brew_hibiscus_high_v1  -->

That's it, you can vary the amount of tea you use of course.

### Cold Brew Cacao

Now to throw a spin on this. You can also do this with cacao nibs and get a "tea" from it. Cacao nibs if you don't know are the cacao bean after its been fermented, roasted, cracked, and removed from the shell. It is the purest form of chocolate, however it is quite bitter.

I was intrigued by the guy at the Mountain View farmers market selling it (along with other chocolatey treats).

So now a copycat recipe with an additional twist. First iteration!


#### Minty Cacao Cold Brew.

| Ingredient        | Amount         |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Cacao Nibs        | 1.5 tbsp (42g) |
| Peppermint Leaves | 3 tbsp (10g)   |
| Water (filtered)  | 6 cups (1.5L)  |

**Edit 5/1** Updated 3 tbsp of Peppermint leaves is 10g not 84g.

Same steps as above. Remember that cacao nibs are bitter, the taste of this is different to say the least, like a hint of chocolate flavor.
A further experiment if this goes well would be to concentrate the brew down and see what I can do with the resulting concentrate. Powerful chocolate flavor infusion on demand!

I'd add sweetener of course if you plan on making this yourself. Its different as I said.


## The Making of

### Hibiscus High
So as a start, I made hibiscus tea via Mountain Rose Herbs [Hibiscus High](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/hibiscus-high-tea/profile) its pretty good and tangy via orange peel and rose petals, the red is from hibiscus obviously.

            title="Hibiscus Ingredients"
            caption="" %}

Again the fancy glass pitcher is exactly [Ovalware's Cold Brewing Glass Carafe 1.5L](https://www.ovalware.com/products/coldbrew?variant=12978540249143) pretty highly reviewed on Amazon too.
The stainless steel filter is removable as soon in the image.

As far as filtered water goes, I have big boy [zerowater dispenser](https://www.zerowater.com/40c-readypour-glass.php), for all my filtered water needs, dispenses 2.5 gallons (~9.5L) of water.

            caption="" %}

After measuring and adding all of the ingredients you will see that the water begins to be tinted red immediately after a shake.  Its already beginning.

            title="Hibiscus Start"
            caption="" %}

Fast forward 9 hours and here it is.

            title="Hibiscus After 9 hours"
            caption="That red tint!" %}

I think I'll leave it overnight to do its thing.

### Mint Cacao Cold Brew
So as a start, The [Cacao Nibs](https://amazon.com/Cacao-Organic-Superfood-SOW-BLOOM/dp/B0776ZZN2Y) are from Sow+Bloom they have it up on Amazon.
The [Peppermint Leaves](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/peppermint-leaf/profile) are from Mountain Rose Herbs.

            title="Cacao Ingredients"
            caption="" %}

Again after measuring and adding all of the ingredients you will see that the water begins to be tinted slight brown, I'm not sure if its from the mint or cacao nibs, interesting...

Fast forward 9 hours and here it is.

### Hibiscus High
Taste tested on April 30th. The hibiscus wasn't as strong a flavor as I hoped so more time is needed.

### Mint Cacao Cold Brew
Amazing! The experiment was a success! More of the peppermint came through though, so next batch which is already in progress has a lot more cacao nibs this time.
I was quite worried the bitterness of the nibs would be present which is why I cut back on them, but it wasn't bitter at all (the farmer's market vendor's version was slightly bitter).
It was a very smooth mint chocolate flavor.

I would do a further experiment to see if I can concentrate the flavor down.

A reminder of the chocolate mint tea I used to do with [Chocolate Mint](http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?taxonid=250929&isprofile=0&) leaves. Yes there is a mint variety that smells like chocolate.
Its rather hard to find because you can't grow from seed, you'll need a cutting. Experimented with one back in 2014 when I found one at the Mountain View Farmers Market, but it died, and haven't been able to find another one.

## Edits
