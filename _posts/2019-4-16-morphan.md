## What is it
Morphan is a vector graphics sprite animator, users are able to draw sprites using various graphics primitives (lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, polygons, and bezier curves) and specify keyframes.  Users can then edit the keyframes ever so slightly by adjusting the control points of each primitive.  The tool also has a player that shows up what the animation will look like. The player interpolates between the keyframes to animate your sprite.

I made this for an idea for a mobile game I was designing, however I don't do mobile games anymore, but it was a fun project nonetheless.

## Inspiration
This tool was inspired from the graphics of Geometry Wars

Enemy ships in the game are based off graphics primitives and are a very simplistic design which adds to the charm of the game.

## Technologies used
It is a desktop application built in C++ using the [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/) for the UI.  The GUI was designed in [wxFormBuilder](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/)

The save data for a morphan is in the [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) format, so a reader can be easily made by using protoc to generate the deserializer.

## Challenges
The implementation of moving components.  This requires to knowing the minimum bounding box for each primitive, the code for a minimum box for an arc was particularly tricky due to the way the control points for an arc are specified.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
You can create functional units, but using the snap to point feature this allows you to connect graphics primitives together easily and modify control points which would modify that point for all of the primitives that share that point.

## What I learned
Some computer graphics algorithms such as finding a bounding box for various shapes with the most challenging being an arc, smooth interpolation, some trig math involved with generating regular polygons. This was an extension of some techniques I learned in Computer Graphics while I was an undergrad at Georgia Tech.

## What's next?
It's generally complete and it can be used, there are some nice quality of life stuff that should be implemented such as: undo/redo functionality, implement operations for all primitive types.  And some code maintainence stuff.  The player code can be reused in other C++ applications.
