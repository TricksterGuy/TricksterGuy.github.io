Food post 3x chain! The streak continues with smoothies. My method of defense against hunger, filling me up with fat, fiber, and protein, one serving of this will fill you right up. The general recipe I go for is explained here.

## Equipment.

Yeah the Vitamix blender. Pretty powerful machine, put any food in there and its completely liquified, resulting smoothies are very smooth. My model has several preset programs built in.

A wonderful investment. I don't like grittiness.

## Recipe

### Basic Methodology

This recipe should be good for keto, its been working for me. Good way to get more plant based foods into diet.

| Ingredient                                   | Amount                   |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Nut Milk (Coconut, Hemp, Macadamia, Almond)  | 1 cup (240 mL)           |
| Water                                        | 1/2 cup (120 mL)         |
| Greens (Baby spinach, kale works fine)       | 2 cups                   |
| Seeds (Chia/Flax +Fiber, Hemp Seed +Protein) | ?                        |
| Nuts (Pecans, Walnuts, etc.)                 | 1 oz (28 g)              |

In general the formula is Milk+Liquid, Powders, Greens, Seeds and Nuts.

I don't like using fruit in smoothie, but I guess one could get by with either lemons, blackberries, or raspberries.

* [Pecans](https://www.bluemountainorganics.com/organic-sprouted-pecans.html) +Fat

So didn't have to go all out with a complex recipe, but the smoothie iterations are tailored to what I am missing that day. If I need more greens then up the Greens / Baby Spinach.  More protein? Add more Hemp Seeds or Whey Protein.
Lower Carbs even further? Remove some of the powders half the amount of nuts. Need more Calories? Add more Hemp Seed Oil or Nuts. So many variables involved, I have a giant spreadsheet with them all.

Also I only consume sprouted nuts these days. They taste so much better than non sprouted and have a slightly sweeter flavor.
Supposedly the sprouting process makes the nutrients in the nut more bioavailable, and reduces phytic acid from them (which is said to be an anti-nutrient).

I get nuts from [Blue Mountain Organics](https://www.bluemountainorganics.com), great for snacking!

## The Making of

Weigh in, I tend to weigh food to know how much I'm eating, and to calculate nutritional information.

## Review

The extra addition of nuts to the smoothie helped the creaminess immensely. The taste was kinda rich, I guess with the extra fat from hemp seeds / oil and the nuts.

The Super Greens taste is really hard to mask and its pretty strong, I'm used to drinking these but it may be a challenge for people not used to it.

As far as effects, felt very full and satisfied after drinking 2/3rd of it (roughly 2 glasses).

## Styrian Pumpkin Seeds Story

To not crowd the recipe section with random stuff no one cares about :^)

I discovered Styrian Pumpkin Seeds looking for healthy oils, needed something different as I was getting sick of always olive oil in salads (haha no offense meant I love olive oil :^)).
And at the same time finding sprouted pumpkin seeds from a good source, because I was sick of manually sprouting raw nuts myself, then I'd forget about it and they'd be left to ferment or get moldy, egh!
So found Blue Mountain Organics, and [Podor](https://www.podoroils.com/products/cold-pressed-oils/styrian-pumpkin-seed-oil), just the smell of this stuff. The first time I had it I was at work and my coworker brought in his dog for the first time.
His dog was very shy until I had my daily salad, sprinkled that on top and dog wanted to be my best friend immediately. All dogs will love you if you have food, but none for him.
