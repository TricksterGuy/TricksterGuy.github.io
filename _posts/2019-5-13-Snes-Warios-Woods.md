Who knew a puzzle game in the Mario universe starring Toad, Birdo, and Wario existed?

## About the Game
Wario's Woods is a very unique puzzle game. It is of the "falling blocks" and "match 3" variety. But unlike most puzzle games where you either control the
pieces directly, or manipulate the playing field with a cursor you control a playable character directly in the playing field in all of the madness.

The "falling blocks" in the game are either monsters or bombs of various colors. The primary objective in the game is to eliminate all of the monsters with the
bombs that fall by matching 2 or more monsters with 1 or more bombs, horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally. The instant a bomb is adjacent to 2 entities
of the same color they are destroyed. You lose if the screen fills up with monsters and/or bombs and you can't move anymore in the playing field.

## Story
Apparently Wario has taken control of the peaceful forest and is trying to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom by using some sort of spell. These events apparently
from Wikipedia happens right after Super Mario World. Well Mario's on vacation with Peach, Yoshi has his own game and is fighting with Bowser at Yoshi's
Island... so Toad you can take this one!

Toad has to travel through the Woods that has been taken over by Wario and eventually get to his castle to undo the spell over the woods.

There are 100 rounds in the main game ending with Toad saving the day from Wario.

## Gameplay
Toad is the main character, Birdo is a supporting character, and Wario is the antagonist. The game is played starting with Toad and Birdo along with Wanda
a fairy who supplies Toad with bombs to destroy the monsters. However there is a timer and once it runs out Wario comes in and replaces Birdo and Wanda is
replaced with a pigeon who spawns more monsters while Wario lowers the ceiling, represented by a huge angry Thwomp. Once the timer runs out again Wario leaves
and is replaced with Birdo again. Before Wario leaves though, the pigeon may lay an egg. These eggs are bad because they contain a monster and there's a 50/50
chance when the egg hatches it will rain monsters of that type. A parting gift from Wario to make your day worse.

As far as controls they do take some getting used to. Toad is a strong boi and can pick up stacks of monsters as long as the thwomp doesn't get in the way, that
is, if a stack of monsters is right below the thwomp there's not enough space for Toad to pick it up. The A button allows Toad to pick up the entire stack,
while the B button allows Toad to pick up the monster right next to him from the stack (while the ones above will fall immediately after). Toad amazingly can
also climb up stacks of monsters by walking up it sideways... weird. Other moves Toad has is while he's carrying at stack of monsters A will drop them in the
direction Toad is facing, B will drop only the bottom most monster in the stack in the direction he is facing, X will allow Toad to drop the stack of monsters
where he is standing and he will rise to the top of the stack. Toad can also kick monsters with the Y button and they will go sliding off in the direction
kicked.

So obviously you want to maximize your Birdo time and minimize the Wario time. You can perform tricks to extend the time Birdo is up and while Wario is up
doing those same tricks will decrease the amount of time Wario is torturing you. The trick is to chain monsters being destroyed, if a bomb activates eliminating
some monsters then as a result of that another bomb activates eliminating monsters then you get more time for Birdo or less time for Wario depending on who is
up. Along with that these same tricks are key to raising the thwomp when Wario lowers it as long as you can match 3 monsters diagonally, match 4 or more
monsters in any direction, or use a crystal (explained below) the thwomp will rise up.

So to efficiently clear the screen of monsters you need to make sure not to leave bombs of colors where no monsters exist, because due to this bombs of that
unused color will still be generated, wasting time a space, Even worse if Wario pops up he will send monsters of that unused color. As long as a color doesn't
exist no bombs or monsters of that color will appear.

Another trick and new type of entity on the playing field are crystals. Crystals are similar to bombs in that they need to be adjacent to two entities of the
same color to activate. Once a crystal activates all monsters of the same color of the crystal are destroyed, this does not remove bombs of that color so the
strategy is to activate the crystal with leftover bombs to ensure no bombs of the same color exist. How does one form a crystal? If you make a match of 5 or
more in a single direction then a crystal is formed. You can also form crystals even if one of the 5 was a crystal itself. The crystal generated will be a
random color (that is still in play) so its luck of the draw whether its useful or not.

Lastly are lives and the odd design choice here. Each level starts out with 5 * ((level / 10) + 1) coins. For each switch of characters, Wario will take some
number of coins. When you clear a level the coins will rain from the sky, but collect them quickly. They disappear fast!

Did you get the odd design choice? **For each switch of characters**, that means once Wario shows up you are definitely guaranteed to lose coins again unless
you get lucky. The odd thing is doing chains while Wario is up *decreases* the amount of time Wario is torturing you, which means you have less time to complete
the level before Wario leaves and you lose more coins. You are punished for doing well. It should have been you lose coins when Wario comes in that way you
don't feel cheated for doing tons of combos to reduce the amount of time Wario is up.

And past round 99 after the ending you have the choice to continue playing, but boy is it hard. Look how ravenous Wario is. He wants revenge!

Nothing too exciting, just a small cutscene lol.

Toad blows up Wario's Castle, sadly he just got that in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3. It would take 9 years for Wario to repair his castle in Wario World...


## 2 Player / VS CPU
The game was also adapted to multiplayer, the rules are the same, except at the end of the VS CPU mode you go up against Wario himself. The characters are not
of the Mario universe ranging from a Witch, to a Knight, to a March Hare lookalike from Alice in Wonderland. Its weird that they came up with these weird cast
of characters and never used them again for anything.

The differences between this and the main mode are that its 2 players each player gets their own game board. The main win condition is the same, be the first to
clear your board and you win. However the other win condition is to make it so the other player gets crushed by their thwomp. You can lower the other players
thwomp by performing tricks, as you do so their thwomp will lower, possibly due to the jealousy of watching the other player do well in the game and wants to
put pressure on you to do better.

Some moves from the main game do have effects on your opponents board, for better or worse:

* Chains will cause a stack of monsters to randomly appear on the opponents board all the way up to the thwomp, as well as increases the amount of time Wanda is
giving you bombs, or decreasing the amount of time the pigeon is giving you more monsters.
* Using a crystal will not only destroy all monsters of a single color from your board, but will also devastate your opponent by changing all unused bombs into
monsters.
* This one is weird. If you destroy monsters in a boomerang shape like a zigzag. The character will shout Breakfast! (the audio is kinda terrible) and an egg
will be sent to your opponent. There is a 50/50 chance when the egg hatches that it will rain monsters of that type.
* And again clearing 4 or more monsters or any tricks can lower the opponents thwomp.

Sorry for the video quality, apparently I'm bad at videos. I will figure out this program and fix the video later.

I do like when games provide multiple ways to play. You can either go all offensive and try to distract the other player, or go strategical and clear your
board.

One negative thing I have to say is after you complete the game you can play again in "hard mode". However all they do is stack the odds against you. Give you
more monsters to clear. So the strategy is more towards attacking the opponent.

The odd design choice with all of this is the fact that doing chains sends a column of monsters to your opponent. This is good for near the start where vertical
space may be short. But near end game the opponent can simply lift the stack and put it on top of a bomb for an instant crystal. Its not an effective strategy
unless you pull off like a 6x chain which would completely trap the opponent. If I had to change the design of this I would make it do stacks of monsters in
alternating colors so it wouldn't just simply be pick up the stack and bomb.

Crystals are too overpowered and I think it should just change bombs of the same type of the opponents board to monsters, though if that above change was made,
I'd keep it the same as crystals would become much harder to come by.
