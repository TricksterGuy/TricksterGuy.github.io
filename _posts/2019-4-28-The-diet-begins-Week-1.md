So as it was written in a previous post, I am to start my diet again today. I am bound to what I write or tell people. This post documents my diet and the types of foods I eat and avoid.

Disclaimer not a doctor, just sharing what worked for me, I've lost so far 105 pounds doing this. Research and talk to your doctor before starting a new diet or supplement.
Also I'm not paid to advertise any product its just what I am using currently and what I settled on after research.

## Diet
My diet is keto and I did the following things.

1. I used a macros calculator online here's [one](https://perfectketo.com/keto-macro-calculator/). This will tell you how much fat, carbs, and protein you need. Generally most people will say to stick to upto 20-50g of net carbs (net carbs meaning total carbs - dietary fiber - sugar alcohols) per day. Most days I got it under 25g a day. Make sure to eat the right amount of protein and not too much as the body can convert excess protein into glucose.
1. I weigh all of the food I eat to have a more accurate measure of what I am eating, I also log all of the food I eat along with the macros. This allows you to see patterns in your eating and help balance your meals, or eliminate bad choices.
1. I also do [intermittent fasting](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide), where I only eat within an 8-12 hr window. It gets easier to perform after a few weeks on the diet, the maximum amount of fasting I did was 18 hours.
1. I do some exercise per week, biking to/from work, HIIT classes provided by my apartment complex, along with a few visits to the gym at around 11pm.
1. I do testing for blood ketone levels near the start to verify I'm in ketosis, past that point its not useful as long as you are consuming the correct amount of macros and not going overboard.

## Supplements
Some supplemental products I regularly consume/use

* [Hyperbiotics](https://www.hyperbiotics.com/) probiotic supplements - I use the time release pearls, and the prebiotic powder, just to ensure my gut bacteria stays healthy.
* [Lyteshow](https://www.lyteshow.com/) Electrolytes - You will need to replenish eletrolytes in case you don't get enough from food. During the initial stages of keto you lose a lot of water weight when you body burns off glycogen stores, along with that water are electrolytes.
* [Equip Micro Greens](https://www.equipfoods.com/products/micro-greens-micronutrient-powder) Greens Powder  - To be honest the taste isn't that great at first, but provides 14 servings of fruits and veggies. Used when I feel I didn't eat enough veggies in a day.
* [Whey Protein](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZS3CC1) - Used in case I don't get enough protein in a day, only has 1g carb per scoop and provides 24g of protein.

As far as food goes, I generally do 1 bigger meal with a protein, a salad or sauteed greens, a smoothie, and some snacking of nuts. I generally eat around 1400-1800 calories a day and lose about 3-5 pounds a week.

## Typical Day
So as an example of a day of eating for me.

* You may notice that net carbs doesn't equal total carbs - fiber. Chocorite has sugar alcohol in it which isn't included on the table.

Replace the Steak with any protein, Chicken, Shrimp, Fish.

### Smoothies
As far as the smoothie goes, I have a spreadsheet of about 40 recipes now. The smoothie template is of the following:

1. 1-2 cups Nut Milk (Macadamia, Hemp, Coconut, Almond)
1. Protein / Greens Powders
1. Oil (Hemp Seed, Olive, Coconut)
1. 3-6 cups Greens (Baby Spinach, Spring Mix, etc.)
1. Seeds (Chia, Flax, Hemp)
1. 1-2 oz Nuts (Pecans, Walnuts, Almonds, etc.)
1. Other additions (Cacao Nibs, Avocado, Mint, etc.)

You can really mask the flavor of whatever greens you use in the smoothie quite well. And of course add water if it is too thick in the end (I usually add upto one cup depending on if I use chia/flax seeds).
Depending on how much liquid you add it can be 1-2 glasses full.

## Replacements
For most people the biggest hurdle is "omg I can't live without X", I've found that you can "fake" these foods, its not going to be exactly 100% the same (still haven't found a good pasta replacement I like), but it will be tolerable.

* Bread - I find that this [recipe](https://www.fatforweightloss.com.au/recipe/keto-bread/) is very good, it consumes a ton of eggs however but doesn't have that eggy taste.
* Rice - You can use [Miracle Rice](https://miraclenoodle.com/collections/miracle-noodle-rice-products), or just pulse broccoli or cauliflower in a blender/food processor works well.
* Pasta - Yes its tough! There's also Miracle Pasta! Zoodles (Zucchini Noodles) are a thing as well. There's also Hearts of Palm pasta. Nothing compares to traditional pasta though.
* Tortillas - I find this [recipe](https://www.ruled.me/low-carb-tortillas/) works quite well. You can also toast them in the oven over a little oil to crisp them up for chips.
* French Fries - This one is tough! I love my fries, but if you can find it Parsley Root makes a good substitute a herby fry, but I've heard celery root being an option (although slightly higher carb).
* Soda - Swear off it! Drink some sparkling water instead. I prefer [Spindrift](https://spindriftfresh.com/), another fizzy drink I do is [KeVita](https://www.kevita.com/products/sparkling-probiotic-drink/) water kefir drinks (Lemon Cayenne). Kombucha works too (although higher carb).
* Chips - Replace with Pork Rinds, if I get a craving I go for [Protein Crisps](https://shrewdfood.com/protein-crisps/) buy the Pizza flavor, the cheddar is too salty and the sweet flavors aren't too great alone.
* Chocolate - There are several low carb chocolates out there sweetened with sugar alcohol, I liked [Chocorite](https://chocorite.com/) and [ChocZero](https://www.choczero.com/) products.

I will probably post some of my recipes in the future.

## Keto Flu
Another big hurdle is keto flu. When your body transitions into ketosis this may happen, you may experience flu like symptoms as your body enters ketosis.
Its generally your brain switching from carbs to fat as the main energy souce. The best way around it is to make sure you are consuming enough fat, drink plenty of water, take electrolytes, and get plenty of rest.
I usually get the keto flu about a week after starting and the "flu like" symptoms only last a day for me.

## Last word
So yeah thats the basic rundown, I'm probably sure I got some information incorrect (please let me know!), just google keto diet there's ton of information out there.

But the information presented is what has been working for me. I did this 4 years ago and lost 80 pounds, and I have been doing this 8 months now and have only been off it 3 times.
