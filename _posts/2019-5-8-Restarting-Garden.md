So just now restarted my Aerogarden.  If you didn't know Aerogarden is a an easy to use hydroponic garden system.  You can start an indoor garden easily.

## Hydroponic Gardens.

In a hydroponic garden system plants are grown with no soil. Just suspended in water. There are numerous benefits to this, in a hydroponic garden plants will grow much faster than in soil and the yield is also greater.
Apparently [source](https://www.hydroponics.net/learn/hydroponic_gardening_for_beginners.php) there's more oxygen which means more root growth and plants absorb nutrients faster. The nutrients are directly added to the water.
The plant doesn't have to waste energy and can use that energy instead for growing. And since we are growing indoors a simple lighting system can provide the light needed for photosynthesis.

All that's needed is buy their equipment and you can buy ready made seed pod kits which comes with everything needed to start a garden. They have all varieties from Italian Herbs to Flowers.
But for me I don't do ready made stuff, another option is to buy a grow anything kit which just includes the pods, grow sponges, labels, and grow domes along with the liquid fertilizer.

## Seeds... Seeds.

What to grow..? What to grow..? this question lingered in my mind.

Well I generally loved Italian food so gotta go with **Basil**, at least for pesto and flavoring tomato sauce. And Basil is a true bro, plant basil seeds and that seedling will popup in just 2-3 days being wassup bro! Basil more like Brosil amirite?
Its a great test to see if your garden will thrive.

**Tomatoes!** Another idea which I did previously was to start a tomato plant and then transplant to soil when it got big enough. I've had great success doing so last year and got a decent yield.
Which variety of tomato though?  Well obviously the best one for saucing, that'd be the San Marzano tomato. A tomato that originated from Italy and it's a type of plum tomato. You'll find that many sauces imported from Italy are made with this variety.
Its flesh is thicker, doesn't have many seeds and is stronger and sweeter. It is the best tomato. Growing this combined with basil instant pasta sauce winner right there! Basil and tomato are best friends. You can't really find San Marzano's in grocery stores.
Unless you hit up Whole Foods at the right time of year, or your nearest farmers market. A good second best is the Roma tomato, they are similar. San Marzano is pretty much its dad! as its a cross between the San Marzano and two other varieties (via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marzano_tomato))

**Sage** comes to mind, as I love sausage and chicken and waffle with its peppery, sorta woodsy notes. Pairs well with pork and chicken, one of my favorite herbs. Plus growing sage is said to make you good at business / be successful.

**Holy Basil**. I've only heard of this type of basil from the anime called Food Wars. Food Wars is 100% me, take a normal type anime and make it about food, which each major character having their own little special ability.
Most of my food experiments were spawned off from watching episodes, it does a great job showing cooking techniques and secrets. Of course an anime must have its over the top reactions and of course serving up that *fan service*

Foodgasm at 2:26. This was one of the more tamer reactions... Others especially involving female characters... Well lets say the fan service was served piping hot :^)
{: .smaller}

So yeah in one of the episodes one of the "secret surprises" added to a dish was Holy Basil, so now I have to grow this for myself.

**Lavender** always been a fan of it, and usually sleep to it if I have my diffuser on. Its a very calming herb/flower, and some varieties can also be used in cooking. I have experimented with lavender leaves in cooking, they have a little rosemary note to it.
Too much and you get a bitter piney taste, so a little goes a long way there. And I wouldn't be surprised if lavender is a relative of rosemary.

**Peppermint**. Another flavor I enjoy. Peppermint candies as a kid, great breath freshener and also calming. Mint varieties do very well, but they can go OUT OF CONTROL if left alone. You don't really need to do anything except keep it watered and it will grow and grow and grow.
I have to be sure to keep it properly contained as it will take over the entire hydroponic garden.

**Savory**. I don't know it would be interesting as you don't generally find this herb as a seasoning. It may be good IDK it was included in a seed set I purchased.

**Shiso**. Ahh I had a drink with shiso in it while at the [Taste of Atlanta](http://www.tasteofatlanta.com/) festival can't for the life of me remember the name of it, but I have seen it in grocery stores. Anyway its a drink in a green jar with the fruit in it, and oh god can't remember the fruit either.
I really hate when I forget small details like this, so this will be edited the next time I go grocery shopping. Anywho it was pretty wonderful, mix that drink with ginger beer and you get something special. Well this will be a surprise if I can get leaves from this, would be a cool experiment.

**Nasturtium**. I've done this one, learned of this from *good friend who made me start this blog* after hiking at a park nearby after he locked himself out his house. Haha that was a funny story, but yeah just pointed them out while hiking, completely edible plant.
Intrigued, I found seeds online and attempted to grow it. Had some success, the hard part here is getting one to germinate, afterward it is a wild grower.
Last time I did this I made pesto with some of the leaves. The taste of the leaves is very peppery, I like it. Hopefully I can get it to germinate again and go as far as to get it to produce flowers.
Well he'll definitely have moved to Europe by that time sadly... so Nasturtium gifts maybe? So yeah doing it again in his honor.

            caption="Haha seriously here are the seeds, big boi seeds" %}

**Lemon Balm**. Another great easy herb to grow. Literally this thing TOOK OVER the entire garden, I wouldn't be surprised if this thing was a relative of the Mint family. Mints are very easy to grow.
Anywho the leaves make a great tea it has a nice pleasant citrusy taste of lemons, supposedly also good for regulating blood glucose levels. Another fun fact the essential oil (Melissa) is super expensive because it takes so many Lemon Balm flowers to produce.
And Lemon Balm only produces so many flowers 3 tons are required to produce 1 pound of oil.

**Greek Oregano (Wild)**. Another favorite of mine. Yeah this is not your average oregano. Oregano harvested from the mountains of Greece. It is very hot and spicy! Add it to a pizza for an outstanding treat! Seriously store bought plain oregano doesn't compare.
Also the wild oregano has many supposed health benefits. Anti-everything pretty much. If I get a sore throat (ugh) I just swish with juice made from the stuff and instantly gone. Its pretty potent.
Anywho I only use it for mild discomfort of course seeing a doctor for more serious stuff, but used as a first line defense. *Let food be thy medicine*.

If you want a product to try. I exclusively buy [this brand](https://amazon.com/Greek-Wild-Oregano-Fantis-Bunch/dp/B00IPMXV1A) of dried wild oregano. Super fragant, strong oregano.
The only negative is the whole stems are included with the leaves and the stems can prick you if you can't careful. I just have the entire bunch in a ziplock bag and rub the bag if I need oregano.

## What not to grow

So of course not everything is possible with the Grow Anything kits. Don't grow any root veggies because you need special equipment apparently to support that.

Indeterminate varieties of tomatoes can't be handled. They'd just go TOO out of control.

Anything that requires a ton of space. So no watermelons! Your home would be covered in vines, as the watermelon takes over everything.

And in my own personal experience. German Chamomile. I also love chamomile as a companion to lavendar. Plus it tastes so darn great, made chamomile ice cream once.
But unfortunately everytime I tried it in the aerogarden, it gets moldy. Like a big white fuzzy mold grows along with it. Ugh I was using some leaves for tea and noticed the mold afterward...

I am deathly afraid of mold. Especially when you have food stored in opaque containers that you have to open. I'm sure most people have parents who do that and forget about them.
So yeah mold scares me, I try to use food so I don't have much waste. So I guess `mycophobia` as it extends to mushrooms too, weird things that pop out of the ground unexpectedly and are poisonous.
I won't eat any dish with mushrooms either (if they are the main component). The exception are truffles. Truffles are delicious! Welp someone is either going to use this as oppo research or researching stuff I like for gifts.

Yeah I guess a small spray bottle with a little vinegar may help that, but I was too freaked out by the experience. I may try growing chamomile the normal method.

## The equipment

I have the [Aerogarden Elite Bounty](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B01IK7PX88). Capable of housing 9 plants at once. It is expensive, but I got a *juicy deal* on one. Thanks to price trackers.

            title="Setup"
            caption="The aerogarden." %}

How it works is the top part has special leds optimized for plant growth. Each pod fits in each hole as shown in the image.

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-8-Restarting-Garden/aerogarden_leds.jpg"
            title="Leds"
            caption="The leds on top, it really lights up in patriotic colors :^)" %}

Underneath the top on the base...

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-8-Restarting-Garden/base.jpg"
            title="Base"
            caption="The base with a water pump." %}
There's a pump underneath which circulates the water to the grow sponges so the top part of the sponge remains moist and better circulation of nutrients.

As mentioned above for each slot you need:

* Grow sponge which you place seeds in
* Grow Basket which holds the grow sponge
* Seeds of course!
* Label
* Grow dome which helps the seed germinate

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-8-Restarting-Garden/components.jpg"
            title="Components"
            caption="Grow Basket, Grow Sponge, Label. Didn't have any domes, but ordered more!" %}

So the steps are as follows. Because I didn't have an iron you are to take the label place it on the grow basket and use the iron to apply heat.
Next best thing since my stove is a glass top, just turned it on low. Carefully place the label on top and smack it down on the heating element.
Glad I didn't start a fire at 11 PM and get a noise compliant (ugh).

Next prepare the grow sponge by placing the seeds in the tiny hole at the top. Grow sponges are hit or miss, some of them aren't cut properly and the hole may just be a slit.
Luckily most seeds I have are tiny bois.

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-8-Restarting-Garden/lavender.jpg"
            title="Lavender Seeds"
            caption="Lavender seeds are very tiny." %}

Insert the grow sponge in the grow basket with the label.  Also be sure to label before ironing on haha.

Then insert the grow basket in the aerogarden unit.

Once you have all of them in. Now time to add the liquid fertilizer. Most times its just two capfuls and then fill with water.

            img="/images/2019-5-8-Restarting-Garden/nutrients.jpg"
            title="Liquid Nutrients"
            caption="The liquid nutrients, the smell ain't too great." %}

And here's the aerogarden almost set up.

## Aerogarden Day 0

{% include image.html
            img="/images/2019-5-8-Restarting-Garden/aerogarden_in_action.jpg"
            title="In action"
            caption="The aerogarden turned on, still missing them grow domes. I'll get them today!" %}

So this model has a fancy UI which allows you to control various parameters.
When you first turn it on it asks for several options to optimize the use of the grow lights and phases.
Herbs, Flowers, Tomatoes, Peppers, etc. Depending on the setting determines when the lights come on and off.
Or how long the germination process takes.

Well this is just a starter post. I will do more as things happen.
