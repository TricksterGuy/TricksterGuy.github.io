Food post 2x chain! The streak continues with *sad* food. The bare minimum amount of cooking effort I need to exert per day. Its quick, and all you need is a pressure cooker. I do it right from frozen.


## Equipment.

Yes the instant pot, the 7 in 1 thing everyone has and raves about. I had one in my price trackers after my mom got a pressure cooker (not sure if instant pot). 2 years later it goes on sale on Amazon for half price. Score!

The thing scares the crap outta me sometimes, randomly releasing steam as I watched it the first time in awe.

How it works is it heats the liquid you place in the pressure cooker to boiling, as steam builds up so does the pressure, there is a locking mechanism that builds up the pressure.  It gets real hot inside there so foods don't need that long to cook.

## Recipe

### Basic Methodology

| Ingredient                  | Amount                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Chicken Breast or Thigh     | ?                        |
| Water or Broth/Stock        | 1/2-3/4 cup (120-180 mL) |
| Seasonings                  | ?                        |
{: .table .table-responsive-lg}

So once all of the ingredients are in place seal the pressure cooker and I typically cook on high pressure for at least 10-12 minutes and after the cycle is complete just let out the pressure.

That's all there is to it. Be sure to use the leftover liquid for something else, it should be extremely flavorful.


### Today's Variation

| Ingredient                  | Amount                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Chicken Breast              | 7.6 oz                   |
| Chicken Bone Broth          | 3/4 cup (180 mL)         |
| Garlic Powder               | 1/4 tsp                  |
| Onion Powder                | 1/4 tsp                  |
| Birds Eye Chili Powder      | ~1/2 tsp                 |
| Oregano                     | ~3/4 tsp                 |
| Black Peppercorns           | 1/4 tsp (like 6 of them) |
| Apple Cider Vinegar         | 1 tsp                    |
| Salt                        | 1/2 tsp                  |

Bone broth from [Kettle and Fire](https://www.kettleandfire.com/), zero carb. grass fed chicken bone broth.

Chicken Breast from [Greensbury](https://www.greensbury.com/). If I'm going to eat meat, I'll make sure they had a good life. Organic, Free Range, Antibiotic Free, Humanely raised. Yeah, I have a **lifetime** discount with them.

Depending on how I want to spin this the seasonings can be different. If I want to go Italian, I'd remove the ACV toss in some rosemary and marjoram, and finish with some tomato sauce after pressure cooking.

Here the intention was to use with a hot/buffalo sauce. Had I went with 1/2 c of liquid instead of 3/4 c in the above recipe I would have just reduced the broth down and added the hot sauce for a more flavorful dish.

I just grabbed a packet of Chick-fil-a Zesty Buffalo Sauce (all out of Frank's Red Hot Sauce unfortunately), and ate.


## The Making of

Weigh in, I always weigh food these days to know how much I'm eating, and to calculate nutritional information.

            caption="Weighing" %}

Oh if you are wondering the scale is [Etekcity's Digital Kitchen Scale](https://www.etekcity.com/product/100167), its alright I like that it came with its own bowl, I do hate the beeping when you turn it on, and the auto turn off feature.

A visit to my spice rack and I ponder what will I use. I'm too lazy to actually refill them...

            caption="Yes, I like very hot spices over on the right." %}

And if you are wondering, the jars are from [Gneiss Spice](https://gneissspice.com/) s/o to Beth, the owner, who personally signed my order once. I forgot what she said though... Oh it was her favorite spice, I forget which one though...

After adding all of the ingredients to the inner pot.

And set the pressure cooker.

            alt="Pressure Cooker"
            caption="All set and ready to go" %}

And here's the finished chicken. Doesn't look too appetizing, as I mentioned at the start it is a *sad* dish.

Well that's it.

There was so much liquid left over that I just had to put it in a mug and drink it. I need them electrolytes and can't let it go to waste.
